This is a testbench designed to verify the design of a two-input mux.
The design:
  The design has four 32-bit inputs and a 2-bit selector and a 32-bit output. The four inputs are assigned
  to four channels internally whose channel values are 0 through 3. The 2-bit selector is used to select 
  which channel to send to the output.
The testbench:
  The testbench is based on the UVM architecture. The TB implements the following:
    - Stimulus generation with randomization
    - Data checking
    - Functional coverage capture
Run simulation:
  At the base directory, run these commands:
    - source env.sh
    - cd sim
    - make compile_mux
    - make run test_name=mux_demo_test
Lab instructions:
  - There are Todo actions that are to be completed incrementally 
  - At the end, after all Todo actions havve been completed, the student is to demonstrate that the testbench
    can be compiled and run successfully. This proves that all Todo actions have been completed as intended.
